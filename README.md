# ml-supervised-regression-cost-functions
Repository for projects which implement different cost functions for different regression models

## OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)
OLS method can be used in case of Simple Linear Regression i.e. when we have single independent and dependent variable also called as univariate dataset
-ml-supervised-ols-simple-linear-regression.py has an example implementation for OLS method

## Gradient Descent 
Gradient Descent Algorithm could be applied for multivariate dataset i.e. when we have multiple independent variables and single dependent variable.
-ml-supervised-gradient-descrent-single-variable.py has an example implementation for Gradient Descrent Algorithm for univariate dataset
