# ml-supervised-regression-cost-functions
Repository for projects which implement different cost functions for different regression models

## OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)
OLS method can be used in case of Simple Linear Regression i.e. when we have single independent and dependent variable also called as univariate dataset
- ml-supervised-ols-simple-linear-regression.py has an example implementation for OLS method

## Gradient Descent 
- Assume a function f(x), with Gradient Descent we try to find that value of 'x' where the first order derivate f'(x) becomes zero. Algorithm tries various values of x before arriving at a value where f'(x) = 0
- Gradient Descent Algorithm could be applied for multivariate dataset i.e. when we have multiple independent variables and single dependent variable.
- ml-supervised-gradient-descrent-single-variable.py has an example implementation for Gradient Descrent Algorithm for univariate dataset
